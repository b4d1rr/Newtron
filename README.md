🚀 Newtron
The Universal AI Command Bar.
Newtron is a system-wide, ultra-lightweight interface that bridges the gap between your local machine and the world's most powerful AI models. Built with Rust for speed and TypeScript for agility, it’s designed to be the only search bar you’ll ever need.

One keystroke. Total control. No API fees.

Current Status: 🏗️ Under Active Development

Last Updated: Feb 8, 2026 (GMT+3)

🧠 The Vision
Most productivity tools are either too heavy (Electron bloat) or too expensive (API markups). Newtron flips the script by using a Zero-API Architecture. It leverages your existing AI accounts via secure, hidden sessions, giving you a premium AI experience for the cost of... nothing.

✨ Features
Universal Search: Instant access to local files, apps, system settings, and Git repositories.

AI Threading: Query ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini instantly. Results appear in a beautiful, scrollable result box.

Performance First: Powered by Tauri, ensuring minimal RAM and CPU usage while staying "always-on."

Keyboard-Centric: Triggered by a global shortcut (Alt + Space), keeping your hands on the keys and your flow intact.

Visual Excellence: Awwwards-level Glassmorphism UI with fluid animations.

E2E Security: Your credentials stay in your OS keychain. We never store your chats.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Core: Rust (Tauri)

Frontend: React + TypeScript

Styling: TailwindCSS + Framer Motion

Database: SQLite (Local indexing)

Automation: Playwright/DOM Injection logic

🛠️ Status & Installation
[!CAUTION] UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT > Newtron is currently in a "stealth" development phase. We are not providing public binaries or installation tutorials at this time to ensure the core engine is stable before the first alpha release.

Roadmap to Alpha:
[ ] Stabilize Rust-based global shortcut listeners.

[ ] Finalize the "Zero-API" WebView injection logic.

[ ] Complete the Glassmorphism UI kit.

[ ] Public Alpha Release.

🛡️ Privacy & Security
Local stays local: File indexing happens entirely on your machine.

Session Security: Your AI login sessions are handled via your system's native keychain (AES-256).

No Middleman: Your queries go directly from your machine to the AI provider.

🤝 Contributing
Newtron is currently a closed-contribution project while we finalize the architectural foundation. Stay tuned for the open-source call to action.
